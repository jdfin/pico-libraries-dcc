// This is used for decoding an incoming DCC bitstream.
//
// DccBit receives as input 'edges' (rising or falling). It synchronizes
// (a bit can be high then low or low then high), recognizes preambles and
// start/stop bits, assembles packets of bytes, and calls a client-installed
// callback when a packet of bytes is received.
//
// This is not used for generating a DCC bitstream.
